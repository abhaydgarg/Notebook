# Good to know

## Number of ways the single number can be represented or viewed in decimal system

There are different number of ways the single number can be written or represented in base 10. Let take a number 25 and a few ways it can be written are:

- 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1....till 25 = 25
- 20 + 5 = 25
- 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25
- 30 - 5 = 25
- 125 / 5 = 25
- 5 x 5 = 25
- 5^2^ = 25
- $\log_{5}25$ = 5

## Multiplication is a repeated addition

If the same number is repeated then, we can write that in the form of multiplication.

!!! example
    2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2

    Here 2 is repeated 5 times, we can write this addition as 5 x 2 (5 times 2).

    First term says how many times. 5 times 2.

## Division is a repeated subtraction

If the same number is extracting from another number till you reach 0 then, we can write that in the form of division.

!!! example
    - 10 − 2 = 8
    - 8 − 2 = 6
    - 6 − 2 = 4
    - 4 − 2 = 2
    - 2 -2 = 0

    Here 2 is extracting 5 times from 20, we can write this subtraction as 10 / 2.
