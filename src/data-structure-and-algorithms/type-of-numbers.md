# Type of numbers

## Main types

### Natural numbers

The set of numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,....., that we see and use every day. The natural numbers are often referred to as the **counting** numbers and the **positive** integers.

### Whole numbers

> 0 + Natural numbers.

The natural numbers plus the zero.

### Integers

Positive and negative whole numbers {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

### Rational numbers

Number that can be written as a ratio of two integers. A rational number is a number that can be in the form `p/q` where `p` and `q` are integers and `q` is not equal to zero. Since `q` may be equal to 1, every integer is a rational number.

| Number          | Rational                                                                     |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 5 => 5/1        | yes, since denominator may be equal to 1, every integer is a rational number |
| 1.75 => 7/4     | yes                                                                          |
| −0.1 => −1/10   | yes                                                                          |
| 0.111... => 1/9 | yes, non-terminating but repeatable pattern                                  |
| 7/0             | no, denominator can't be 0                                                   |

### Irrational numbers

It is a number that cannot be expressed as a fraction `p/q` for any integers `p` and `q`. In other words, it has decimal part that is non-terminating and non-repeatable pattern.

| Number                      | Irrational                                      |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| $\sqrt2 = 1.41421356237...$ | yes, non-terminating and non-repeatable pattern |
| $\sqrt7 = 2.64575131106...$ | yes, non-terminating and non-repeatable pattern |

### Real numbers

Nearly any number you can think of is a Real Number.

## Types of integers

### Even numbers

Any integer that can be divided exactly by 2. For example, −24, 0, 6 and 38.

### Odd numbers

Any integer that cannot be divided exactly by 2. For example, −3, 1, 7 and 35.

### Prime numbers

Lets understand **Factor** first.

Numbers we can multiply together to get another number. A number can have MANY factors!

!!! example "What are the factors of 12?"
    - 3 x 4 = 12, so 3 and 4 are factors of 12.
    - 2 x 6 = 12, so 2 and 6 are also factors of 12.
    - 1 x 12 = 12, so 1 and 12 are factors of 12 as well.

Now, **Prime** numbers are **positive integers** greater than 1, that have exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself. In other words, prime numbers are exactly divisible by the 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11.

!!! question "is number 5 prime?"
    Lets find out the as many as factors of 5.

    - 1 x 5 = 5, so factors are 1 and 5.

    Yes, 5 is prime number because there are exactly two factors, 1 and number itself.

!!! question "is number 6 prime?"
    Lets find out the as many as factors of 6.

    - 1 x 6 = 6, so factors are 1 and 6.
    - 2 x 3 = 6, so factors are 2 and 3.

    No, 6 is not prime number because there are more than two factors, 1, 2, 3 and number itself.

#### Why 1 is not prime

Because it does not meet the criteria for being a Prime Number, which is a whole number with exactly two factors, itself and 1. One has only one factor which is 1.

### Composite numbers

A composite number is a **positive integer** greater than 1 and which is not prime (i.e., which has factors other than 1 and itself, in other words, more than two factors)

!!! info
    1 is neither prime nor composite.
