# OOPS

Basic building entities and concepts available such as classes, objects, interfaces, encapsulation, abstraction, design principles, design patterns empower programmer to code flexible solution. There is a universal truth that everything is changing and sooner or later application is also need to be changed. OOPS languages provide programmer an advantage in form of its basic building blocks as mentioned above, which are when used smartly then help programmer to write code which could become flexible that means any change in future or any new addition in future to application can be done without altering the existing code in a large scale and in lot of classes. Therefore, OOPS language is getting more popularity for application development.

## Class

A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the specific behaviors. Class is a user-defined data-type out of which as many as objects of class type are produced. In programming languages, we have an primitive data-types such as Integer, Double, String etc. Similarly, class is also a data-type but created by programmer which is composed of variables and methods.

Visualize class as data type is become very useful to establish relationship among classes. For example:

* Related classes means classes of same type are best to group through inheritance. If we properly identify the same type of classes then we have a "is-a" relationship which is best to implement through inheritance and having same type automatically conform to LSP design principle.

* Un-related classes means the classes of different types can also be grouped together and relationship among them can be established with help of interfaces.

## Object

Object is a working entity. Also an instance of a class. As many as objects or instances can be created from single class. Think like, we have Integer data type in language which is called primitive type and available to programmer to create as many as variable or instance of type Integer. Similarly, class is a data type and out of which programmer can create as many as instances or objects of that specific class type.

## Type of variable in class

* **Local variable:** Variable defined inside class method and constructor.
* **Instance variable:** Variable defined outside class method and constructor but instantiate when object is created through new keyword.
* **Class variable:** Variable defined outside class method and constructor but with static keyword.
