# Views

A view is nothing more than a SQL statement that is stored in the database with an associated name. A view is actually a composition of a table in the form of a predefined SQL query.

Views, which are a type of virtual tables allow users to do the following âˆ’

* Structure data in a way that users or classes of users find natural or intuitive.
* Restrict access to the data in such a way that a user can see and (sometimes) modify exactly what they need and no more.
* Summarize data from various tables which can be used to generate reports.
