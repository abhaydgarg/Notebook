![semvertable](../assets/semvertable.png)

## Pre releases

Use `-` to separate type of snapshot release, "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"

For example `1.0.0-beta`, `1.0.0-rc`, `1.0.0-preview`, `1.0.0-alpha`

### Alpha

Work-in-progress and experimentation.

### Beta

Feature complete, but may contain known bugs.

- **Target audience**: Developers with active Universal, DXperience and VCL Subscriptions eligible for major updates.
- **Purpose**: Allows developers to explore new functionality within existing projects and report issues prior to release.
- **Expectations**: Implements functionality fully, low probability of defects, low likelihood of breaking changes in final implementation, product is scheduled and should be released in an upcoming major version.

### RC (Release Candidate)

Release that's potentially final (stable) unless significant bugs emerge.

- **Target audience**: Available to all active subscribers.
- **Purpose**: Documentation may be incomplete and minor issues could exist.
- **Expectations**: Fully functional with only minor issues. No breaking changes are expected in final implementation though documentation may still be incomplete.
