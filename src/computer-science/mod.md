# Mod

In computing, the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another (sometimes called **modulus**).

## What is remainder?

`19 รท 5` is `3` with a remainder of `4`, which means that `19` can be divided by `5` into `3` parts but with `4` left over.

**In programming** `19 % 5 = 4`
