# Modularity

The idea is to focus fully on one thing at once; build one thing to do its job very well. Once you have addressed and built all these separate concerns in isolation—meaning they’re probably very modular, decoupled, and encapsulated—you can begin bringing them together into a larger project.

Think of modules as Lego pieces which enable you to build website. When you connect them together in the right way, they form web pages. To build websites like Legos, you have to think of websites as a collection of **independent and decoupled modules**.

**Modular design** can be seen in cars that parts of the car can be added or removed without altering the rest of the car, such as more powerful engine or seasonal tires can be added easily without any change to other units of the car such as the chassis, steering, electric motor or battery systems.

For example, let's say we want to build a page. You can think of the page as a complete unit, and of the smaller pieces as belonging to the page. That approach is **top-down** thinking and results in code that’s full of one-offs and special bits that only live a single page. It’s not conducive to writing reusable code. What Modularity asks you to do is step back, and instead of thinking about this at the page level, look at the fact that your page is made up of small chunks of discrete content. It is **bottom-up** thinking. It asks you to start with the reusable building blocks that your entire page is constructed from.

## How to modularize

Modules should be created by feature.

## Why modularization

Modular approach makes the code easy to reuse and maintain when scale. It is very efficient and widely used approach in large projects. If code is not organized into separate and independent parts, then it is harder (or impossible) to use it else where. Decoupled and independent modules can easily be maintained in sense that you can easily remove, update certain module and replace it with new one without disturbing the other modules. Also, code is short, simple and easy to understand and it allows multiple programmers to collaborate on the same application.
