# Replication

> The action of copying or reproducing something

Replication is the process of synchronizing data across multiple servers.

Replication provides redundancy and increases data availability. With multiple copies of data on different database servers, replication provides a level of fault tolerance against the loss of a single database server. You can also maintain additional copies for dedicated purposes, such as disaster recovery, reporting, or backup.
