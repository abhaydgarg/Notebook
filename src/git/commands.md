# Commands

## push and pull

> pull = fetch + merge

```bash
# If branch name is missing then git picks the active branch.
# Active branch = develop.
# Then push to develop and pull to develop.
git push
git pull

# Push and pull from specific (develop) branch.
# Just checkout to the branch and run pull or push.
# There is a way to push and pull from branch if
# you are into another branch. Do not do this.
# It is just a matter of one more command.
```
