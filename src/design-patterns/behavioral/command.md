# Command

It turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. It is simply **a layer between the object that implements a method and the object that wishes to invoke that method.** Having separate layer in-between lets you delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.

This is most powerful in the world of user interface.

## Problem

Imagine that you’re working on a new text-editor app. Your current task is to create a toolbar with a bunch of buttons for various operations of the editor. You created a very neat `Button` class that can be used for buttons on the toolbar, as well as for generic buttons in various dialogs.

While all of these buttons look similar, they’re all supposed to do different things. Where would you put the code for the various click handlers of these buttons? The simplest solution is to create tons of subclasses for each place where the button is used. These subclasses would contain the code that would have to be executed on a button click.

Before long, you realize that this approach is deeply flawed. First, you have an enormous number of subclasses and your GUI code has become awkwardly dependent on the volatile code of the business logic.

And here’s the ugliest part. Some operations, such as copying/pasting text, would need to be invoked from multiple places. For example, a user could click a small “Copy” button on the toolbar, or copy something via the context menu, or just hit `Ctrl+C` on the keyboard. But then, when you implement context menus, shortcuts, and other stuff, you have to either duplicate the operation’s code in many classes or make menus dependent on buttons, which is an even worse option.

## Solution

Good software design is often based on the principle of separation of concerns, which usually results in breaking an app into layers. The most common example: a layer for the graphical user interface and another layer for the business logic. The GUI layer is responsible for rendering a beautiful picture on the screen, capturing any input and showing results of what the user and the app are doing. However, when it comes to doing something important, like calculating the trajectory of the moon or composing an annual report, the GUI layer delegates the work to the underlying layer of business logic.

In the code it might look like this: a GUI object calls a method of a business logic object, passing it some arguments. This process is usually described as one object sending another a _request_.

![The GUI objects may access the business logic objects directly](../assets/cmd-1.png)

The Command pattern suggests that GUI objects shouldn’t send these requests directly. Instead, you should extract all of the request details, such as the object being called, the name of the method and the list of arguments into a separate command class with a single method that triggers this request.

Command objects serve as links between various GUI and business logic objects. From now on, the GUI object doesn’t need to know what business logic object will receive the request and how it’ll be processed. The GUI object just triggers the command, which handles all the details. You’ll implement a bunch of command classes for every possible operation and link them with particular buttons, depending on the buttons’ intended behavior.

![Accessing the business logic layer via a command](../assets/cmd-2.png)

The next step is to make your commands implement the same interface. Usually it has just a single execution method that **takes no parameters.**

!!! question "Since the command execution method doesn’t have any parameters, how would we pass the request details to the receiver?"
    The command should be either pre-configured with this data, or capable of getting it on its own.

Let’s get back to our text editor. After we apply the Command pattern, we no longer need all those button subclasses to implement various click behaviors. It’s enough to put a single field into the base  `Button`  class that stores a reference to a command object and make the button execute that command on a click.

As a result, commands become a convenient middle layer that reduces coupling between the GUI and business logic layers.
