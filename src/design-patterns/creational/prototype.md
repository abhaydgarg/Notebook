# Prototype

It is based on **cloning** a pre-configured object. The idea is that you pick an object that is configured for the default properties or settings and then you clone this object and configure it with different settings to your exact needs.

## Problem

Say you have an object, and you want to create an exact copy of it. How would you do it? You have to go through all the fields of the original object and copy their values over to the new object.

Nice! But there’s a catch. Not all objects can be copied that way because some of the object’s fields may be private and not visible from outside of the object itself.

## Applicability

If you want to create an object but do not want to go through the expensive object creation procedure where network or database calls are made, then use the prototype pattern. Just create a copy of the object and do your changes on it or configre it the way you want.

## Code

```ts
/**
 * The example class that has cloning ability.
 * We'll see how the values of field
 * with different types will be cloned.
 */
class Prototype {
    public primitive: any;
    public component: object;
    public circularReference: ComponentWithBackReference;

    public clone(): this {
        const clone = Object.create(this);

        clone.component = Object.create(this.component);

        // Cloning an object that has a nested object with backreference
        // requires special treatment. After the cloning is completed, the
        // nested object should point to the cloned object, instead of the
        // original object. Spread operator can be handy for this case.
        clone.circularReference = {
            ...this.circularReference,
            prototype: { ...this },
        };

        return clone;
    }
}

class ComponentWithBackReference {
    public prototype;

    constructor(prototype: Prototype) {
        this.prototype = prototype;
    }
}

/**
 * The client code.
 */
function clientCode() {
    const p1 = new Prototype();
    p1.primitive = 245;
    p1.component = new Date();
    p1.circularReference = new ComponentWithBackReference(p1);

    const p2 = p1.clone();
    if (p1.primitive === p2.primitive) {
        console.log('Primitive field values have been carried over to a clone. Yay!');
    } else {
        console.log('Primitive field values have not been copied. Booo!');
    }
    if (p1.component === p2.component) {
        console.log('Simple component has not been cloned. Booo!');
    } else {
        console.log('Simple component has been cloned. Yay!');
    }

    if (p1.circularReference === p2.circularReference) {
        console.log('Component with back reference has not been cloned. Booo!');
    } else {
        console.log('Component with back reference has been cloned. Yay!');
    }

    if (p1.circularReference.prototype === p2.circularReference.prototype) {
        console.log('Component with back reference is linked to original object. Booo!');
    } else {
        console.log('Component with back reference is linked to the clone. Yay!');
    }
}

clientCode();
```

```
Primitive field values have been carried over to a clone. Yay!
Simple component has been cloned. Yay!
Component with back reference has been cloned. Yay!
Component with back reference is linked to the clone. Yay!
```
