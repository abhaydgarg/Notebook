# Introduction

First stable release, Rust 1.0 was released on May 15, 2015.

The goal of Rust is to be a good programming language for creating highly concurrent, safe and performant systems.

> Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency.

Rust doesn’t use an automated garbage collection system(GC) by default.

## Rustup

Rustup installs The Rust Programming Language. Rustup installs **`rustc`, `cargo`, `rustup`** and other standard tools to Cargo’s `bin` directory. On Unix it is located at `$HOME/.cargo/bin` and on Windows at `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin`. This is the same directory that `cargo install` will install Rust programs and Cargo plugins.

> rustc --version
